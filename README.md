Python app to convert typed keys into animalease (Animal Crossing Speech)

Maybe i'll try to expand and do other sounds like inkling, but the most important thing for now is update this sounds with the ones that are used in the new horizons keyboard, options to change the language and extra sounds for all the other keys beside letters.
